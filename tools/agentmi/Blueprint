Sure! Below is a **task description** and a **blueprint for the project**. It will guide you step by step on creating this **local LLaMA-powered coding agent** project, from installation to folder structure, and the code required to get the task running.

## 🎯 **Task: Build a Local Coding Assistant using Code LLaMA**

### Objective:

Build a local **coding assistant** that uses the **Code LLaMA model** (via Ollama) to:

1. Read a given **task/specification** (e.g., "build a todo list API"),
2. Plan the code by breaking it down into steps (TODOs),
3. Generate full code based on the specification.

This assistant will function similarly to **GitHub Copilot**, but all interactions will happen locally in your environment.

### Project Requirements:

* Use **Ollama** to run the **Code LLaMA** model.
* Use **Python** to interact with the LLaMA model.
* Provide the assistant with a task specification in plain text.
* The assistant will generate the code based on the specification and print it to the terminal.
* You’ll work within a **VS Code environment** for ease of development and testing.

## 📁 **Project Folder Structure**

```plaintext
llama-code-agent/
│
├── llama_agent.py              # Main Python script for interacting with Code LLaMA API
├── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
├── README.md                   # Project description and instructions
└── specs/
    └── task_spec.txt           # Example task specification (can be expanded for testing)
```

### Explanation:

* `llama_agent.py`: The script that sends prompts to the LLaMA model and gets responses.
* `requirements.txt`: Contains necessary dependencies (e.g., `requests`).
* `specs/`: Folder for storing multiple task specifications.
* `README.md`: Provides information about the project and setup.

---

## 📋 **Blueprint**

### 1. **Set up the project environment**

#### a. Create the Project Folder

1. Open **VS Code** and create a new project folder, e.g., `llama-code-agent`.
2. Open the folder in **VS Code**.

#### b. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

1. Open the **VS Code terminal** (Ctrl + \~).
2. In the terminal, run the following commands to set up a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (MacOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### c. Install Python Dependencies

1. Create a **requirements.txt** file in the root folder with the following content:

```plaintext
requests
```

2. In the terminal, install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. **Install Ollama and the LLaMA Model**

#### a. Install Ollama (if not already installed)

Run the following command to install Ollama (once):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### b. Pull Code LLaMA Model

Once Ollama is installed, you need to pull the **Code LLaMA** model:

```bash
ollama pull codellama:13b-instruct
```

> **Note**: Make sure the model is downloaded and ready before running it.

---

### 3. **Write the Code (Python script)**

#### a. Create the `llama_agent.py` Script

Create a new Python file `llama_agent.py` inside the project folder, and paste the following code:

```python
import requests
import json

# Function to call LLaMA API
def call_llama(prompt: str, model: str = "codellama:13b-instruct") -> str:
    url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
    payload = {
        "model": model,
        "prompt": prompt,
        "stream": False
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()["response"]
    else:
        return f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}"

# Example task specification
task_spec = """
You are a coding agent. Your task is to:

1. Read the specification.
2. Plan the steps as TODOs.
3. Generate the complete code.

Specification:
- Build a Flask REST API to manage a todo list.
- Each todo has a title and a completed flag.
- Support: add, delete, list todos.
- Use in-memory storage (no DB).
"""

# Call LLaMA to generate code
response = call_llama(task_spec)

# Print the response
print("\n--- Response from LLaMA ---\n")
print(response)
```

### b. Create a `task_spec.txt` file inside the `specs/` folder:

This is where you can write your task specifications (you can add multiple specs for testing different tasks):

```plaintext
Specification:
- Create a Python script that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th number.
- The script should output the sequence in a list.
```

---

### 4. **Run the Project**

#### a. Start the Ollama Model

In a **separate terminal window** or **Mac Terminal**, run the following command to start the Ollama model:

```bash
ollama run codellama:13b-instruct
```

This will start the LLaMA model locally at `localhost:11434`.

#### b. Run the Python Script

Now, in the **VS Code terminal**, run your script:

```bash
python llama_agent.py
```

You should see an output like this:

```plaintext
--- Response from LLaMA ---

TODOs:
1. Set up a Flask app.
2. Define a Todo model with title and completion status.
3. Create endpoints to add, delete, and list todos.
4. Implement in-memory storage for todos.
...

# Full code generated by LLaMA follows:
```

---

### 5. **Extend & Test**

* **Test with different tasks** by changing the contents of `task_spec.txt` and passing it as an input to your script.
* **Explore the generated code** and manually add the Flask app for handling todos, for example.

---

## 📑 **README.md Template**

You can add the following content to the `README.md` file for future reference and to explain how to set up the project:

````markdown
# LLaMA Code Agent

## Project Overview
This project uses **Code LLaMA** via **Ollama** to create a local **coding agent** that can:
- Read task specifications in natural language.
- Generate code based on those specifications.
- Break down tasks into manageable TODOs and provide full code implementations.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Clone the project and navigate to the project folder:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd llama-code-agent
````

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Ollama

Follow the instructions on [Ollama's website](https://ollama.com/install) to install Ollama.

Then, pull the Code LLaMA model:

```bash
ollama pull codellama:13b-instruct
```

### 3. Run the Project

Start the Ollama model in a terminal window:

```bash
ollama run codellama:13b-instruct
```

Then, run the Python script to generate code:

```bash
python llama_agent.py
```

### 4. Testing Different Tasks

You can modify the task specifications by editing the `specs/task_spec.txt` file. Then, rerun the script to see how the assistant responds.

## ✅ **Final Summary**

Here’s your roadmap:
1. **Create a folder** for the project.
2. **Install dependencies**: Python, virtualenv, and Ollama.
3. **Set up Python script**: `llama_agent.py` to interact with LLaMA.
4. **Run Ollama** to start the model.
5. **Call the model from the script** and get code suggestions.
6. **Extend tasks** for different coding projects.

This should give you a solid foundation to build your local **Code LLaMA-powered assistant** and test it with various tasks!
